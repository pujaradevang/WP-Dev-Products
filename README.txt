Part 3: Add Taxonomy for “Target Groups”
We want to be able to assign specific products to specific target groups, so you please create
a taxonomy to allow for that and have it assigned to the post type you’ve created earlier.
A product may be in one or multiple target groups.

taxonomy, so you please create a settings page for your plugin, which is accessible through
the WP Admin menu, where we can choose our default out of the existing items.

Part 5: Display only “Products connected to the current Target Group” in the Widget
When the page is called with a target group parameter like
http://youcodingchallenge/?target=developers then the widget you’ve created earlier is
supposed to only show product items which are connected to the given target group.
If no target parameter was passed (http://youcodingchallenge/) or the target passed does
not exist (http://youcodingchallenge/?target=target_that_doesnt_exist), fall back to the
default target group you’ve enabled in part 4.

BONUS: Remember the target group
When a target group is given in the url parameters and the given target group exists, this
always is to be used and remembered.
If no target group is given or it doesn’t exist, but a target group from a previous visit was
memorized, reuse that.
Only if none of the above applies, fall back to the default.
And remember: Your plugin that covers all of the above parts should be installable using the
tools Wordpress provides by default.

Comment: 
This bonus point explanation done in Point 5.

We have added additional shortcode as [wp-products] which can be included in page or templates.

Note: To check with previously visisted page we have used PHP SESSIONS but we can also used COOKIE and LOCAL STORAGE.

I have generated this plugin from https://wppb.me/ and added required functionality as per the requirements.
